#User Registration
Users can register for a vaccine by providing the following mandatory information:

Name
Phone Number
Age
Pincode
Aadhar Number
This information is crucial for scheduling and verifying vaccination appointments.

#User Login
Registered users can log in using their phone number and a password set during registration. The login functionality ensures secure access to user-specific features.

#View Available Time Slots
Users can view available vaccination time slots for a given day. The available time slots are categorized based on vaccination status (first dose, second dose) and display the time ranges (e.g., 17th Sep 10 AM to 17th Sep 11 AM).

#Vaccination Slot Registration
Users can register for a vaccine slot by selecting an available time slot. Registration is categorized into first dose and second dose, and users can only register for the second dose after completing the first dose. Once a user registers for a slot, that slot becomes unavailable for further registrations unless the user modifies their registered slot.

#Admin Login
Administrators can access the app using their admin credentials, which are manually created in the database. Admin login provides access to administrative features.
